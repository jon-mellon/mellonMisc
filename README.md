# mellonMisc
A miscellaneous set of Jon Mellon's R functions

This is a beta version of the mellonMisc package. No code is guaranteed to be suitable for anything. With that said, there are various neat wrappers and utility functions in this package. Some code in this package is adapted from other sources (apologies for anywhere this is not adequately attributed). 

To install just run:

devtools::install_github("jon-mellon/mellonMisc") 

library(mellonMisc)
